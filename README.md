# SilencerPy
Python wrapper for Silencer.

The latest version of Silencer as of June 28th 2022 is included with this wrapper. The Python code is commented pretty heavily which is what can be used as documentation for now. Something more substantial will be available soon.

**Requirements:**

 - Windows 7+ (only tested on 10 and 11), must be 64-bit. This might work with Wine too but that isn't tested.
 - Python (tested on 3.8 and 3.10)
 - [Python.NET](https://pypi.org/project/pythonnet/#history) 3.0.0a2+ (tested on 3.0.0a2 - whatever version you use must be compatible with .NET 5.0). 

You can play around with the `Automation` and `Management` classes using the `testscript.py` file. You can run the script as usual using `python testscript.py` or similar.
